A simple weather widget for displaying current weather data across Denmark.

## How to use the application

### Starting

1. Add a `.env` file to the root directory with your Open Weather Map API KEY.

For example:

```
WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

2. Install depdendencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`

3. Start the application with `yarn start` or `npm run start`

### Testing

`yarn test`

Unfortunately, though these are setup and a few tests are written, I didn't have time to throw
together an adequate test suite.

You'll see the coverage report and everything else is all there, but I couldn't get these up and
running and passing during the time allotted. (My girlfriend is currently hassling me to
go to this food-truck festival in NÃ¸rrebro, unfortunately, but I may be able to get back to this later and will happily discuss how I would have built out the test suite further.)

### Building

1. Add a `.env` file to the root directory with your Open Weather Map API KEY.

For example:

```
WEATHER_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

2. Install depdendencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`

3. Build the application with `yarn build` or `npm run build`
